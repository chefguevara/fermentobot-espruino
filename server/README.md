# Fermentobot-node Server
You can use the server or the ui in a separate mode, in case you want, or you can have them served both all toghether.

## Joined mode
* run 'npm start' and hit `http://localhost:8080` on your browser. That's it.

## Separate mode

### Server
* run `npm i`.
* run `npm run server` will deploy a server at `localhost:8080` by default.

###Â UI
* run `npm i`.
* run `npm start` to start ui at `localhost:3000`.
